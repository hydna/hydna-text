# Introduction

Hydna is a scalable, easy-to-use, hosted platform that enables developers to
send and receive messages in real-time. A large set of interfaces and client
libraries makes communication across platforms (browsers, operative systems)
and devices (computers, handhelds, smartphones) trivial.

Whether it's a website, a native application, a shell script or an iPhone app,
you can leverage the power of Hydna to real-time enable your vision.

You can use Hydna to enhance existing projects, or build entirely new concepts
on the platform.

## Key Concepts

### Streams

Streams are identified by a URI (hostname + stream address). Can be opened in
R, W or E mode.

### Behaviors

Behaviors are powerful. No need to write a server. Can be used for logging,
authentication, backend plugins etc.

### Transports

Wink, REST, WebSockets, Longpolling ...

Wink binary protocol. See spec. Simple to leverage the full potential.
